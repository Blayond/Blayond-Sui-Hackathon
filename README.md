BLAYOND Litepaper V1

What is Blayond
BLAYOND is a SocialFi platform designed for runners who see performance as more than just numbers. By combining AI-powered coaching, Web3 infrastructure, and a socially-driven network, it turns every run into something worth tracking, sharing, and earning from.
It is more than a fitness app, it’s a protocol where data becomes identity, and activity becomes value. With verified challenges, tokenised rewards, and full data ownership, BLAYOND empowers runners to train, connect, and earn on their own terms.
Problems
Runners today face a bunch of headaches. Most running apps, like Strava or Nike Run Club, track your stats but don’t help you improve with personalized coaching or let you earn from your hard work. 
You’re churning out valuable data, miles, heart rate, even your favorite routes, but you get nothing for it while big companies cash in. Plus, finding a community to share tips, compete, or get noticed is tough, especially if you’re not a pro. And let’s be real: staying motivated without rewards or a fun social vibe can make running feel like a chore. 
Blayond fixes these issues by giving you control over your data, AI-driven coaching, and a community that’s all about hyping each other up and earning rewards.

SocialFi Mechanism
BLAYOND transforms running into a social experience where recognition, reputation, and engagement are just as valuable as physical performance. 
Today’s runners aren’t just chasing personal records, they’re building a presence. BLAYOND’s SocialFi system turns every run, journal, and post into shareable proof of consistency, identity, and influence.
At the core of the SocialFi layer is the Community Feed, where users can:
Share runs, journals, and insights as social posts
Receive likes, comments, and tips from fellow runners
Be challenged directly from posts via the “Challenge” button
Share content to external platforms like Instagram or X
These interactions are not passive. Every like, comment, and challenge increases a user’s visibility. 
A dynamic Leaderboard ranks users not only by distance or streaks, but also by community impact, journal quality, and challenge participation. This multi-dimensional system gives runners multiple paths to rise, whether through performance or presence.
To support this, BLAYOND integrates an AI Coach that does more than train, it guides social growth. The AI provides:
Personalised training plans based on user goals
Tips for writing high-engagement journal entries
Recommendations for optimal posting times
Feedback on how to gain visibility through feed activity
This makes every user a potential community leader, even if they’re not the fastest runner. The system rewards:
Consistency (streaks, daily runs)
Authenticity (reflections and journals)
Engagement (responses to and from others)
The SocialFi layer is tightly integrated with BLAYOND’s monetisation model. Runners who consistently engage, share, and build influence may unlock:
Points from completed tasks and challenges
Tips from followers or fans
Access to exclusive brand rewards or opportunities
Optional wallet-based earnings through challenge wagers
In BLAYOND, every run is a chance to connect. Every journal is a contribution to a growing identity. Every social interaction is a signal that builds your presence within the running world. 
This is not fitness for fitness’s sake, it’s fitness for influence, community, and personal brand. The SocialFi mechanism turns effort into recognition, and recognition into real value.

Revenue
BLAYOND combines SocialFi mechanics with real economic incentives through five synergistic revenue streams. These mechanisms align user motivation with platform growth, creating a sustainable ecosystem for runners, partners, and the platform itself.
1. Competition Fees
BLAYOND hosts open competitions where users pay a registration fee to join limited-slot races. The prize pool is collected from participants, and a small percentage is retained by BLAYOND as a platform fee. This model encourages participation while creating a recurring revenue stream from competitive engagement.
2. Head-to-Head Wager Fees
Users can initiate one-on-one running challenges directly from the leaderboard or community posts. Each participant wagers funds, and the winner takes the pot. BLAYOND charges a small percentage fee on each completed challenge, allowing the platform to earn from competitive peer-to-peer activity without interrupting the flow of the game.
3. Brand Reward Partnerships
BLAYOND’s in-app reward system allows users to redeem points for brand-sponsored offers. Fitness brands, wellness companies, and sportswear partners can list their products or services in the rewards marketplace in exchange for listing fees or affiliate revenue agreements. This creates value for users while generating revenue from aligned commercial partners.
4. Top-Up & Payment Margins
To participate in paid competitions and wagers, users need to deposit funds into their in-app wallet. BLAYOND supports fiat and crypto top-ups through QR-based payment systems. A small margin is added to each deposit to cover transaction handling and generate additional platform revenue.
5. Opt-In Data Monetisation
With full transparency and user consent, BLAYOND offers anonymised performance, behavioural, and community data to selected partners. This data can be valuable for sports brands, wellness researchers, or health-focused organisations. Only users who opt in will contribute to this model, maintaining user trust and ethical data use.
Security and Privacy
BLAYOND is built with a security-first and privacy-driven foundation. From the start, the platform is designed to give runners full control over their data, with blockchain technology used to enhance transparency, security, and trust.
All personal data within BLAYOND, including performance statistics, journal entries, behavioural trends, and health-related inputs, is handled with care and stored on a system that prioritises security and integrity. 
Blockchain is used to create a tamper-resistant environment where data ownership is verifiable and protected. This ensures that no information can be altered or accessed without the user's knowledge and permission.
Before any data is made public, included in leaderboards, or shared for optional monetisation, BLAYOND requires clear user consent. Users are asked to opt in to each level of data sharing, with full visibility into how their information will be used. 
Those who prefer to keep their runs private or share selectively can easily adjust settings at any time.
In cases where users choose to participate in BLAYOND's data monetisation features, such as contributing anonymised insights for wellness research or brand analytics, they are required to give explicit consent. No data is sold, shared, or published without the user’s clear approval.
All financial and identity-related activity is also protected. Wallet integration is non-custodial, meaning BLAYOND never holds private keys or manages user funds directly. 
Transactions are completed via secure, user-initiated processes, adding another layer of privacy and decentralisation.
With BLAYOND, privacy is not a side feature. It is part of the product experience. The platform is committed to giving runners full control over how their efforts, insights, and identity are shared and protected, backed by blockchain transparency every step of the way.
